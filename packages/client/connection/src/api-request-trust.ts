/**
 * Browser-trust fence for every /api request. Defends the two confused-deputy
 * paths a browser opens against a local HTTP API — DNS rebinding (Host names
 * the attacker's domain while the socket reaches this server) and cross-site
 * requests fired from a malicious page. The Host fence binds every request,
 * browser-looking or not: over plain HTTP a browser attaches neither Origin
 * nor Fetch-Metadata to reads (images and navigations — those
 * headers go only to trustworthy destinations), so an unmarked request may
 * still be a rebound browser read and Host is the one header rebinding cannot
 * forge. Non-browser and remote clients pass the same fence via loopback,
 * deployment-derived LAN IP literals, or a declared `trustedHosts` authority.
 * Network reachability and authentication stay out of scope: binding policy
 * belongs to the webserver config, and this fence is not an auth layer.
